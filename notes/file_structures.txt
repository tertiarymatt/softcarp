###Notes on file structures

Outsiders should be able to understand your file organization. 
Ultimately you're going to have to repeat your work, because of fiddling,
new data, etc. 
Metadata for data, scripts, structure itself, is an important thing, for 
others and your future self. 

Results is not just output; interpretation, notes, expectations are included.
Ideally these results should be reproducable from a single script; 
a utopian version is the entire project in a single executable file.

Intermediate files probably shouldn't be "manually" fiddled with, long 
running results can be stored and re-used, if needed.

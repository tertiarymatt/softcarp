Notes on ggplot2:

ggplot follows a grammar.
each component contributes to construction of a sentence, i.e. a plot.

ggplot  <- main function, specify data, variables to plot, etc.
aes  <-  aesthetics of plot (shapes, trans, color, fill, line type)
geometry  <- how data will be treated for plot (bar, line, box)
scale  <- how to fit data to plot (continuous, discrete, log)

Data must be in a dataframe to use ggplot!

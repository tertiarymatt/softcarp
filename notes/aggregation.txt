###Data Aggregation - Jenny Bryan, UBC

Working with data in R: probably should just use plyr. 

Can use apply and variants and aggregate, but plyr is more flexible. 

plyr theory: "The Split-Apply-Combine Strategy for Data Analysis", Hadley Wickham

In coding, as in life, one should say what they mean and mean what they say.

plyr:

First letter tells us what we put in, second letter tells us what we get out.
ddply is the main thing, really (see: dplyr).
